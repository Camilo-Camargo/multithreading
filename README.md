# Multithreading

## Introduction

Multithreading is a powerful technique that allows programs to run 
multiple threads simultaneously, improving their performance and 
efficiency. It's similar to event-driven and asynchronous programming,
which aim to use all CPU threads of the computer. In this project, 
we explore the benefits of multithreading by starting with event-driven
and asynchronous programming before moving on to multithreading.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts:

- React: This part of the project implements a 3D game.
- Vanilla: This part of the project implements a 2D game.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Camilo-Camargo/multithreading
```

### Getting Started with React
2. Navigate to the `react` directory:
```bash
cd multithreading/react
``` 
3. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
``` 

### Getting Started with Vanilla
2. Navigate to the `vanilla` directory:

```bash
cd multithreading/vanilla
```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start the game.
That's it! Now you can explore the benefits of multithreading by experimenting with the code and observing the performance improvements in the game.
